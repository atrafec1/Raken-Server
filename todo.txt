# Get all the toolbox talks from this week
# Retrieve the entries just from today
# If there are other days then we will get the previous day entries (We can check if other dates exist)
#If there are other days:

#go through each of todays crews and get their employee history
#Make a table showing their employee history Mon-Sat (If days haven't happened yet then we can leave cells blank)
#If an employee doesnt appear on previous day Crew Allocation entries then we can mark as NW (no work)
#Otherwise we mark this cell as their previous project number


#Need to break this up into different sections:

#API Retrieval of Toolbox talks (Already have this)
#Format the data for easier use (Partially done)
#Use this data for creating the excel sheet (Not done)
